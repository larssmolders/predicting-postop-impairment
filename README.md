# Structural connectivity pipeline for glioma patients to predict cognitive impairment 

Image preprocessing and predictive modeling code used in "Presurgical structural connectivity predicts postsurgical cognitive impairment in glioma patients", L. Smolders, W. De Baene, K. Gehring, R. van der Hofstad, L. Florack, G.-J. Rutten

Code for running the preprocessing pipeline is contained in _preprocess.py_.

Predictive modeling is in _predict_impairment.py_.
